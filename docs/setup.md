## Installing the APWorld
- To install the APWorld, open the Archipelago Launcher and click on "Install APWorld", then select your `kon.apworld` file.

## Configuring PPSSPP
In order to facilitate communication between the Archipelago Launcher and the PPSSPP emulator, you must enable a setting within the emulator.
- Allow remote debugger
  - Open PPSSPP settings and select "Tools"
  - From the "Tools" menu, select "Developer tools"
  - Ensure that "Allow remote debugger" is enabled
  
## Generating
- To generate a game, follow [the official instructions.](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en#generating-a-game)

## Playing
- Open PPSSPP and launch your K-On! After School Live!! ISO; don't progress past the title screen until you are connected!
- Select the K-On! After School Live!! Client from the Archipelago Launcher
- Use the client to connect to your Archipelago server
- After the client has connected to both PPSSPP and the Archipelago server, you can start playing!
  
Ensure that you create a brand new save file each time you start a fresh Archipelago world. If you take a break and come back to the game, ensure you resume from the same save file you have been using. Loading the wrong save file may prevent you from sending certain location checks.
